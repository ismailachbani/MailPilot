                    <h3>Fortune Cookie Wisdom</h3>
                    <p>Occasionally, we'll replace subject lines with profound fortune cookie messages. Life advice has never been so conveniently tucked away in your inbox.</p>
                    <h3>Virtual Pigeon Express</h3>
                    <p>For faster email delivery, we've employed a fleet of virtual carrier pigeons. Please refrain from throwing virtual breadcrumbs at your screen; it confuses them.</p>
